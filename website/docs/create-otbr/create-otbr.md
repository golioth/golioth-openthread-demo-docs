# Create an Open Thread Border Router

The RCP dongle uses a [$10 nRF52 Dongle from Nordic Semiconductor](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/nordic-semiconductor-asa/NRF52840-DONGLE/9491124). Programming this image to the nRF52840 on board turns the mainchipset into a passthrough "modem" for Thread networks, using the 802.15.4 stack from Nordic Semiconductor and the OpenThread project.
