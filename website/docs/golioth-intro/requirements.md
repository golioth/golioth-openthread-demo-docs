# Training Requirements

## Hardware requirements

This is a hardware centric training, so you will need to pre-purchase some hardware to properly follow along. 

### Border Router

This training is based around the Raspberry Pi as a Border Router. It will have an RCP plugged into it via a USB port. It also may be advantageous to have a monitor keyboard set up for this training for direct RPi access.

### RCP

We use [the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 Dongle](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nrf52840-dongle) as the RCP

### FTD
