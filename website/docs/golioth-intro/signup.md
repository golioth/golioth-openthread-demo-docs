# Console Signup and Exploration

This section includes references to [the Golioth docs site](https://docs.golioth.io/). We are linking you there so you have the most up-to-date directions on getting started with the Golioth Cloud. Once you have completed a section, you will come back to this page for further instructions.

## Overview

* **Summary:** Sign up for the Console to get your Golioth account. Go through the wizard steps outlined on the Docs page and on the Console itself in order to provision your first device. The credentials created here allow your device (MagTag for these examples) to authenticate on the Golioth Cloud.
* **Desired Outcome:** By the end of this section you should understand how to add a single device to the console and access the credentials for use on your device.
* **Approximate time:** 5 minutes
